# Building Management System

A building management system (BMS), otherwise known as a building automation system (BAS), is a computer-based control system installed in buildings that controls and monitors the building's mechanical and electrical equipment such as ventilation, lighting, power systems, fire systems, and security systems. 

For this project that will be only a sensor network for the beginning, no control over equipment but monitoring the "health" of the buildings and rooms.

A BMS consists of software and hardware
